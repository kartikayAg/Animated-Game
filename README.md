The Simple Counter project is a basic web application where users can increment or decrement a numerical value by clicking buttons.
It features a counter displayed on the page, which starts at zero. Each click on the "Increment" button increases the count by 1, while the "Decrement" button decreases the count by 1. 
This project is a great way to practice event handling in JavaScript, as well as basic HTML and CSS for layout and styling.
